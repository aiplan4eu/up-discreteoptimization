# up-discreteoptimization

Status as of 26 may 2023, the source code works with the branch scheduling-plan of unifiedplanning library.
Only dependency needed other that unified-planning is the ```discrete-optimization``` library.
You can just install it in your prefered environment :
```pip install discrete-optimization```

If you want to use minizinc based solver, then you have to get minizinc installed too, as explained in the [doc](https://airbus.github.io/discrete-optimization/master/install.html)
